This is the first HTML & CSS project from TOD, in which the task is to recreate the Google homepage.

Skills strengthened/demonstrated:
-basic html
-basic css

Areas to improve:
-understanding how to position elements
	-I realized during the project I didn't have a very good understanding of the following properties and how they are 	differentiated:
		-display
		-position
		-top/right/bottom/left
		-float/clear
-I should also focus on studying flex and grid so that in the future I can rely on them more for positioning rather than tinkering with floats & top/right/bottom/left properties
-making code more efficient; I relied a lot on selecting ids in this project; to make the code more efficient I should revisit this and see if I can use element and class selectors more
